		<h1>Linking and Navigation</h1>
		
		<h2 id="URL">URLs</h2>
		A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.
		End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browser or by clicking a hyperlink found on a webpage, bookmark list, in an email or from another application.

		Anchor text is “exact match” if it includes the exact match of the keyword you are targeting. For example: “seo services” links to a page about SEO services. Anchor text that includes a variation of the keyword on the linked-to page. For example: “SEO Content Marketing Services” links to a page about Content Marketing.
